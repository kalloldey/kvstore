Key Value Server
----------------
By: Kallol Dey, Roll: 123050030, M.Tech. II
============================================================

How to run:
-----------
1. Run the server with 
	'$ go run kvserver.go'.
2. In another tab run the client with 
	'$ go run kvclient.go'.
3. The client will run with some predefined keyword.
4. While client is running everytime a promt will appear. Give command of get or set on that prompt.
5. Tyep command get <key_strictly_of_one_word> for getting a value from server.
6. Type command set <key_strictly_of_one_word> <value, can be of multiple words> to set a value in the server.
7. Type command 'help' to see the several commands available at any time
8. Type command 'exit' to exit the prompt and client program will end.
9. Server program need to be stopped manually by ctrl+D
10.The input.txt contains some set of get and set commands. It can be redirected to the client code  like: 
	'$ go run kvclient.go < input.txt > output.txt '. 
Make sure the kvserver is already running.


Details about the program:
--------------------------
1. The server is a http server and the client is communicating with the server using get methods.
2. As of now only string is supported as a value. 
3. Key is kept as single word for simplicity of giving input. However this can be improved.
4. The backend key value saving is done in hash table.
5. The server is now inmemory and the key-value pair will be lost once server finishes execution.
6. Multiple client can access the server simultaneously and all keys are visible to everybody i.e. no motion of namespace.
7. Evidently key size is limited by the size of a string without space, that go can support.
